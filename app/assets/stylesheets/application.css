 * You're free to add application-wide css to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the css you add here take precedence over css defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create_game a new file per style scope.
